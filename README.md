This implementation includes some functions to:
- Initialize a tree
- Insert a student in a tree
- Remove a student from a tree
- Remove the n'th student (by UF-ID) in the inorder traversal of a tree
- Search for a student by name
- Search for a student by UF-ID
- Print the preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals of a tree
- Print the number of levels in a tree
